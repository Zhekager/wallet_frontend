## My contribution to the project:

- Basic settings and structure.
- DashboardPage (styles).
- PageNotFound.
- Layout && Container.
- Others (minor improvements).

:computer: **Our goal** was to make a site that matches the layout, and also
fulfills all the tasks set from the technical assignment. This site enables the
user to save information about costs and incomes.

## Authorization:

When you first visit this site, you must register by filling out the form.
Otherwise, you enter the appropriate login name (your email address) and the
current password. Finally, you get access to your account. If you do not exit
the site using the exit button and only close the browser window, you can reopen
your site without re-authorization.

## Transaction table:

### As a user, you can create a new transaction that will appear in the transaction table on your home page. To do this, click the appropriate button on the display and fill in all the fields. You need:

- choose the type of operation (cost or income);
- select a category (if it is an expense) from the list;
- enter the transaction amount in the appropriate input field;
- select a date (if you do not do this, the current date will be selected by
  default);
- write a comment;
- In the transaction table you can see the balance of each individual item.

## Overall balance:

- In the left sidebar you can see the current overall balance.

## Statistics:

### If you want to view current statistics:

- on the mobile version you should click on the statistics icon;
- in other versions you must click on the appropriate link called "statistics";
- On this page you can see all your expenses and income, as well as filter your
  transactions for any period, choosing the month and year, if necessary. Also,
  this page displays a cost chart by category.

## Exchange rate:

- In the mobile version, you can see the current exchange rate by clicking on
  the $ icon.
- In other versions, it is displayed on the left sidebar.
